### About Me

> I'm an Electronics and Communication Engineering student deeply passionate about technology and innovation.
>  I’ve been fascinated by how things work—what began with dismantling gadgets at home soon evolved into a drive to create smarter, more efficient solutions to everyday problems.

#### Leadership and Influence:

 I volunteered for Kerala Model United Nations (Kerala MUN) at my school. Being part of such a dynamic event taught me the importance of diplomacy, organization, and collaboration.

#### Networking:

As a first-year student in Electronics and Communication Engineering , I am eager to connect with fellow students, experienced professionals, and mentors through technology events and collaborative endeavors.
My goal is to establish robust networks by participating in community activities, exchanging ideas, and fostering innovative projects. 
By remaining active and setting a positive example, I hope to motivate others to explore, learn, and make meaningful contributions to our expanding tech community.

#### Career Plan:

As a first-year engineering student specializing in Electronics and Communication, my career plan is rooted in my passion for innovation and technology.
I hope to explore areas like IoT, VLSI design, and wireless communication, which I believe are crucial to the future of electronics. 
Eventually, I aspire to work in a research-driven or innovation-focused environment—either at a leading tech company or through my own startup—where I can contribute to cutting-edge solutions that improve connectivity, efficiency, and quality of life.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

As a first-year student, I am convinced that Kerala possesses significant potential to thrive in the technology startup landscape. 
This can be achieved by fostering young talent, promoting innovation within academic institutions, and increasing opportunities for practical experience. 
By enhancing collaboration between industry and academia, providing accessible mentorship, and supporting student-driven initiatives, Kerala can cultivate a vibrant startup ecosystem that empowers future tech entrepreneurs.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

I haven’t had the opportunity to contribute to open-source projects yet, but I’m eager to start exploring this space. 
I’m currently learning how to contribute effectively and plan to work on projects that align with my interests, like web development and AI.

#### History of Community Engagement:

I’m just starting to engage with technical communities, and I’ve been exploring platforms like Discord to learn and share knowledge.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

Currently, I have not created any technical blog posts, articles, or video series. 
However, I am actively seeking opportunities to begin sharing my learning experiences and projects on platforms such as GitHub and LinkedIn. 
My intention is to provide valuable content in fields such as UI/UX, cybersecurity, and web development as I acquire more practical experience.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

I haven’t developed widely used software tools yet.
